## Information security program

* Risk management, security strategy
* Operational and organisational security
* Product security
* Operations security

### Simple security roadmap

**Short-term roadmap:** survive till you get secure

* Quick security assessment
* Easy fixes for easy to identify threats


**Long-term roadmap:** get secure

* Identify risks
* Prioritise mitigations
* Model threats
* Set up controls 
* Deploy
* Monitor
* Iterate
  
### Prioritisation

- Pick risks that matter the most to you
- Pick the most probable threat vectors
- Pick the most easy to exploit vulnerabilities

## Risk management

### Risks and threats

- **Risk**: potential for destruction, damage, or loss of data or assets, resulting from a cyber-threat.
- **Threat**: what magnifies the chances of an loss event, like a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability inside your system.
- **Vulnerability** is simply a weakness in your application, device or process that exposes your sensitive assets to threats.
